# Gestalt Authorities for Stellaris

Gestalt Authorities is a mod inspired by real biology which creates four additional biological hive authorities. These grant increasing levels of cohesion as you progress between them. From the weakest paramind gestalts, whose existences are a shared cultural conception spread by memes, to the one mind gestalts, for whom there is no distinction between the self and the gestalt.

Evolve your hives into truly collective organisms, or dip your toes into the gestalt on non hive empires. Gestalt authorities turns the collective consciousness from a dystopian cold-war era impending threat to a reality of life that may be worth embracing... if you can afford the great sacrifice.
